# Stop Chasing Apps. Own Your Words Like a Damn Adult.

Every few months, somebody discovers a shiny new “writing platform” and posts a dramatic thread like:

> “This changed my life. I have finally found my forever home for thoughts.”

My brother in bandwidth, no you haven’t.

You found this quarter’s content casino.

And look — I’m not anti-tools. I love good tools. I love pretty UI. I love buttons with the exact right amount of clicky confidence. But if your writing system only works while one startup stays solvent and emotionally stable, you don’t own your writing. You’re renting your brain.

That’s the thesis. Simple, rude, true.

## The portability test (a.k.a. “will this still exist in 5 years?”)

Before you commit your ideas to any platform, ask:

1. Can I export everything in a plain, open format?
2. Can I read it with normal software if the service dies?
3. Can I version it, diff it, and back it up without prayer?

If the answer is “kinda, with a paid plan and a ritual,” that’s not ownership. That’s hostage with a settings menu.

### Receipt #1: Markdown and plain text are durable for a reason

Markdown has become boring infrastructure. That’s a compliment.

- CommonMark spec: <https://spec.commonmark.org/>
- Original Markdown description: <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>

Open format + wide tooling support means your writing outlives whichever app got VC money and then pivoted to “AI social journaling for teams.”

## Your “second brain” is probably just files + search + habits

A lot of productivity marketing is just giving old ideas cyberpunk names and charging monthly.

You usually need:

- files you control,
- predictable organization,
- full-text search,
- and a review habit that isn’t made of vibes.

That’s it. Not a neural graph lattice with ten plugins that all break after one update.

If your note system needs a migration guide every six months, you built a hobby, not a tool.

## Why files beat platforms when life gets messy

Real life is chaotic. Laptops die. Companies get acquired. APIs change. You forget passwords. Your future self is sleep-deprived and one minor inconvenience away from choosing violence.

In that moment, plain files are saints.

- They work offline.
- They work with almost any editor.
- They can live in git, cloud sync, local backups, USB drives, whatever.
- They don’t ask permission to exist.

### Receipt #2: Git is literally designed for content history and diffs

People treat git like “dev-only,” but version control for text is useful for anyone who writes seriously.

- Git docs: <https://git-scm.com/doc>

You get history, reversibility, and accountability for free. That’s not nerd vanity — that’s anti-regret engineering.

## “But platforms have better UX”

Absolutely. Many do.

A polished app can feel incredible compared to a folder of markdown files and a mildly judgmental CLI.

But here’s the trade:

- **Great UX, weak ownership** → fast now, fragile later.
- **Good-enough UX, strong ownership** → boring now, resilient later.

If you’re writing throwaway content, choose convenience.
If you’re building a body of work, choose durability.

You can still have nice UI on top of owned files (Obsidian, VS Code, static site generators, etc.). You don’t have to cosplay as a 1998 sysadmin to keep control.

## Publishing without platform dependence is not hard anymore

If your goal is “I want my writing on the web,” you can publish from a git repo and sleep peacefully.

### Receipt #3: GitHub Pages is a straightforward static hosting option

- GitHub Pages docs: <https://docs.github.com/en/pages>

Static site + markdown posts + JSON index + CI/deploy = low drama.

Is it trendy? Not especially.
Is it resilient? Hell yes.

And when you want to move hosts, you move files, not your soul.

## A practical setup that doesn’t suck

If you want a setup that’s durable without becoming a part-time infrastructure goblin, do this:

1. Write in Markdown.
2. Keep posts in a normal folder structure.
3. Track everything in git.
4. Publish with a static generator or a simple build script.
5. Keep at least one off-machine backup.

That gets you 90% of the benefit with 10% of the complexity.

You don’t need to architect a moon mission to publish essays about software, life, and why your toaster has Bluetooth for no goddamn reason.

## The emotional part nobody says out loud

Owning your words changes how you write.

When you know your archive is yours, you stop writing for the algorithm’s mood swings and start writing for continuity. You can revisit ideas, disagree with your old takes, and actually build a long-term body of thought instead of feeding an endless short-form slot machine.

That’s intellectually healthier.

And yes, less profitable for engagement hacks. Cry me a river.

## Final take

Use whatever tool gets you started. I mean that.

But once you care about your writing, graduate from rented land.

Own your files.
Own your history.
Own your publishing pipeline.

Because if your “knowledge system” disappears the day a startup changes its pricing page, that wasn’t a system.

That was a situationship.
