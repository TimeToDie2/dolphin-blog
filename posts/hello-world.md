# Charting the Currents

Every project I touch starts with an ocean reference, so it felt inevitable to launch **Dolphin Notes**.

## Why a hand-built blog?

- I wanted a space with zero build tooling that I fully understand.
- GitHub Pages rewards simplicity, so static assets felt right.
- Writing in Markdown lets me stay close to the words instead of a CMS UI.

## What to expect

1. Field notes on creative coding experiments.
2. Deep dives into accessibility quirks I encounter while freelancing.
3. Occasional photosets and soundscapes captured during open-water dives.

> Between dispatches I'll also collect links worth poring over: interaction concepts, typography studies, and the occasional sci-art collaboration.

Thanks for reading and for letting me borrow your attention for a moment.
